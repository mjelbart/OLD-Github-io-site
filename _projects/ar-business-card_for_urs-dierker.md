Urs Dierker created these intriguing shapes as part of his research in sustainable costume design. We placed these shapes in Augmented Reality to allow people to get up close with some fun art. The android version includes a link to [Urs Dierker's website](https://www.ursdierker.com/), activated by centering the view on the text for 1.5 seconds.
